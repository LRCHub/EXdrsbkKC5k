If your out there let me know
Cause i got nowhere to go
And im all alone
Trying to find my way home
Nobdy told my folks
That i wont commen back
Thats a fact i made my pact
With my pack
And then i made my tracks

Smokes foams across the county line
I lost my legs out my mind
Nothen till i was ever in your place
Then i felt that i could be fine
Thats to be me
Yeah, yeah baby thats the evil I
Something real to find
Stand up and believe it
Baby come on reach for the sky
Keep searchen till the stars are left
Till the end where we first met
Till the farthest darkest corner of the galaxxxyxyxyx
Times won I've lost caught up in the hard to handle
Friends gone family dropped caught up in the hard to channel

I go to bed every night with the fear that i might not wake up again, wake up again
I go to bed every night with the fear that i might not wake up again, wake up again
Blown out roll it again smoken it hold it in and baby don't go with them you don't know what kinda trouble they in
Blown out roll it again smoken it hold it in and baby don't go with them you don't know what kinda trouble they in

I chilled up north on a ranch
Helped out in the summer
Picked up hay bales
Sat up on the porch
While the lightning storm
Slashed with the thunder
Coyotes conniving their grills are smiling
The sounds of the night
I find it hypnotititizzzingiiinggg
My skin was itchy from the bug bites
Im that kid that the bugs like
I'll be back around town about mid may
Don't worry what the kids say
Im on a different look this summer
Clean sweaters no mustard
Nope, well never been a clever machine
Im more of a brute and not really in the scene
Names trashed, veins smashed, sleepen in the sand
Waves crash, pain doesn't have to last
I just sit back and laugh
Im lost with deceit? to my paradise.
Smashed up the highest cash out in your paradise?

I go to bed every night with the fear that i might not wake up again, wake up again
I go to bed every night with the fear that i might not wake up again, wake up again
Blown out roll it again smoken it hold it in and baby don't go with them you don't know what kinda trouble they in
Blown out roll it again smoken it hold it in and baby don't go with them you don't know what kinda trouble they in

I'm straight up slipen sliden
Gripen n grinden
Yeah, unaware of the sounds
Took the stairs to the clouds
No my mouth moves without
Loves one thing that you can't live without
And I am the other one, yeah, yeah

Blown out roll it again smoken it hold it in and baby don't go with them you don't know what kinda trouble they in
Blown out roll it again smoken it hold it in and baby don't go with them you don't know what kinda trouble they in

I'm saddened i was the get away van
I needed a get away plan
The hop in the heavens
Yeah the angeles in the can
My grandad with his stallion
Not really just a quarter horse
My sister held me down
