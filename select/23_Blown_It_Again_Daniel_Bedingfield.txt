I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again
I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again

Finally I'm seeing clearly
I'm writing this so you can hear me
How did I get it in my head that you could do me wrong? No
Since I got to know you better
I found that I was glad I met ya
Why did I listen to those lies when you were standing there for me?

Why did I never tell you?
Why did I not say? Why did I push it away? Hey, yeah
Why did I never trust ya? I could have told you all my fears
All those years, and now I'm ashamed of my ways

I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again
I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again

Diggin' up the heart within me
Dismay is the only feeling I see
I have to say my heart ain't what it could be
Open up the box and tell me what it should be
You can't free a bird if it ain't gone fly
You can't live a life if you don't ask why
Such a thing as too much information
Trapped inside this condemnation

Why did I never tell you?
Why did I not say? Why did I push it away? Hey, yeah
Why did I never trust ya? I could have told you all my fears
All those years, now I'm ashamed of my ways

I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend (One true friend)
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again
I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it

Sorry, I said it, my motor mouth done and did it again
Exceeding speed limit and now I'm feelin' it
I'm knee deep in it, ready to roll like a Jeep with the keys in it
So give me three minutes
'Cause I admit it, I was wrong with no right to expect
Maybe you might just accept my apology
Even though it feels funny
'Cause when a penny drops I'm like "Oh my gosh, I killed Kenny!"
I can't believe I'd end up dissin' a friend, man
I should'a known better than to listen to them
With their see through poisonous lies, deceitful
Made you the last one on my list to speak to, yeah
Sticks and stones, break bones and kill
Word wounds take long to heal
I was wrong for real and I ain't even gon' try to deny
'Cause I missed the mark and I missed it wide

I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend (One true friend)
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again
I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again

I've done it, I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
