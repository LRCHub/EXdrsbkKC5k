[00:02.26] Now the sun is burning
[00:21.96] In deepest space
[00:25.51] That's the way things are
[00:29.44] Through a storm I called you
[00:34.12] It fell each day
[00:37.77] I didn't get so far
[00:41.21] My words get blown away
[00:52.71] 
[01:00.55] My lips are moving
[01:07.48] If you touch my face
[01:09.13] Did you hear my screams?
[01:13.39] While we were sleeping
[01:17.05] I tried to say
[01:21.96] Even in my dreams
[01:25.61] My words get blown away
[01:37.11] 
[02:02.58] Now the sun is burning
[02:06.07] In deepest space
[02:09.69] I didn't get so far
