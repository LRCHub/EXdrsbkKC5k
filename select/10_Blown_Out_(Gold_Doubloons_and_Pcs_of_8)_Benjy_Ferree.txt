Come on, come on, where did she go
She was just here, I need to know
She's the glue that holds me together
She is my pirate treasure
Are you my mother, yes, indeed
One who makes me take off my hat in church
The preacher said someone
Please silence the little bittie baby
If I could keep up with appearances
Running all over the silver screen
But I was blown out at a ripe old age
When I turned 17
I love you, baby, in the morn
Since before the day you was born
Now I need you that I'm hopeless
The hole I'm in is bottomless
You fill my Tank up with oil
Soothing all my blistering boils
While people arrive in warships
To their place of worship
Ever since The 1950s
Things haven't been the same to me
You're born with your own skin tone
But you can't change your name no more
Ice cubes spinning in a glass
Doors are slamming and closing
A loud man is imposing
My flesh is decomposing
Do you even know my name
Do you even know my secret
I sold out my big brother for you
You are perfect wearing blue
If I could go back to the past
I fear I'm running out of time
Would I be crossing the line
If I planned ahead and made you mine
If I could keep up with appearances
Running all over the silver screen
But I was blown out at a ripe old age
When I turned 17
Gold doubloons and pieces of 8
She is my pirate treasure
