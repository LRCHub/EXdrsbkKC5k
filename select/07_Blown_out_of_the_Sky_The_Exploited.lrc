[00:24.49] Tell us the truth
[00:27.17] We've got a right to know
[00:30.08] Forty minutes into the air
[00:32.28] Then came the final blow!
[00:44.78] 
[00:40.10] Blown out of the sky!
[00:50.60] 
[00:59.73] 270 victims on flight 103
[01:05.77] A year has passed already
[01:08.16] And they still withheld the facts from me
[01:28.66] 
[01:16.07] Blown out of the sky!
[01:26.57] 
[02:12.31] They knew two weeks before
[02:14.75] That atrocity was planned
[02:17.93] But all the people at the embassy did
[02:20.67] Was change their own flight plans
[02:37.17] 
[02:28.31] Blown out of the sky!
[02:38.81] 
[03:24.35] 31, 000 feet
[03:26.98] Relaxing with a drink
[03:30.13] How were they meant to know
[03:32.79] That death was nearly theirs?!
[03:36.25] A bomb was planted in the cargo hold
[03:38.96] Put on by a person unknown
[03:42.21] But the government will not admit
[03:44.48] That they know two months before!
[04:00.98] 
[03:52.37] Blown out of the sky!
